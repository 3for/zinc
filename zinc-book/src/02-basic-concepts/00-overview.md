# Getting started

A Zinc project consists of a binary file called `main.zn` and zero or more
library files whose contents can be imported into the binary file.

The binary file must contain the `main` function, which accepts input and witness
data, and returns the output data.

Library files may contain only declarations of types, functions, and constants.

## Zargo circuit manager

`Zargo` is the Zinc circuit manager created to assist in creating,
building, and facilitating circuits through its convenient interface.

The tool is described in **Chapter 9**.
