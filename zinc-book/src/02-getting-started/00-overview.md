# Getting started

## Installation

To start using the Zinc framework, do the following:

1. Download the latest release for your OS and architecture.
2. Add the folder with the binaries to `PATH`.
3. Use the binaries via your favorite terminal.

The minimal Zinc framework consists of the three tools:

- `zargo` package manager
- `znc` Zinc compiler
- `zvm` Zinc virtual machine

`zargo` can use the compiler and virtual machine through as subprocesses,
so you will only need `zargo` to work with your projects.

For more information on `zargo`, check out this [chapter](../10-zargo/00-overview.md).

## The Visual Studio Code extension

There is a syntax highlighting extension for Zinc called `Zinc Syntax Highligthing`.
The IDE should recommend installing it once you have opened a Zinc file!
