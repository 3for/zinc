# Statements

The basic element of the ZRust program is **the statement**.

Statements are divided into several types: 1. Declaration statements 2. Expression statements 3. Control statements

In contrast with Rust, all expressions must be terminated with `;` in ZRust, including ones ending with `}`, that is, `struct`, `fn`, `for` etc.
